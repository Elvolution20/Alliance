<h1>Legal Disclosure</h1>
<p>The materials, any comments or information provided by Alliancecoinmining are for educational purposes only and nothing conveyed or provided should be considered legal, accounting or tax advice.

<h1>Financial Disclosure</h1>
<p>Gross merchandise sales is a non-GAAP metric. We use it to express the total demand across all of our web sites and stores. This number measures the dollar value of the order placed in the year before accruing for certain items such as returns, and it ignores certain timing cut-offs that are required by GAAP for revenue recognition purposes. If we were a public company, we would have to reconcile gross merchandise sales to the nearest GAAP metric (net sales), but we are currently a private company so the gross merchandise sales number should be viewed just as an interesting number that we want to share with our friends.</p>
<p>This document contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, as well as assumptions that, if they ever materialise or prove incorrect, could cause or results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements and assumptions.
 These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the risk of economic slowdown, the risk of over or underbuying, the risk of consumers not shopping online at our website at the rate we expected, the risk of supplier shortages, the risk of new or growing competition, the risk of natural or some other type of disaster affecting our fulfilment of historical operations or web servers, and the risk of the world generally coming to an end.

Alliancecoinmining assumes no obligation and does not intend to update these forward-looking statements.</p>
